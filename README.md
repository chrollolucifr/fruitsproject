# Fruits Data Explorer 🍎🍌🍇

This Python project lets you explore and compare key **physical and nutritional properties** of various fruits.  
It’s a simple, interactive script that uses a clean dataset along with **pandas** and **matplotlib** to display information in both table and chart form.  
It’s perfect for anyone curious about fruits, nutrition, or just looking to practice Python data handling and visualization.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes multiple fruits, with fields like:

- 🍏 Fruit Name  
- 🎨 Color  
- ⚖️ Average Weight (g)  
- 🔥 Energy (kcal)  
- 🥩 Protein (g)  
- 🧈 Fat (g)  
- 🍞 Carbohydrates (g)  
- 🌾 Fiber (g)  
- 🍬 Sugar (g)  
- 💧 Water (%)  

The data has been cleaned and formatted to work seamlessly with the script.

## 🧪 What the Script Does
This script allows you to:

- Select a fruit property (e.g., calories, sugar, fiber)  
- Choose one, multiple, or all fruits for comparison  
- View a neat, **pandas-based table** of the results  
- Automatically generate a **bar chart** to visualize differences  

The interaction is entirely **menu-driven**, so you don’t need to modify any code — just run the script and follow the prompts.
